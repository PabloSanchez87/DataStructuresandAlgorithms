# Heap

We cant think of a heap as an array with a special property: 

    the smallest value is the array is always in the first index of the array.

If we remove the smallest value from the heap, the elements of the array efficiently re-arrange so that the next smallest value takes its place at the front ot the array.

Heaps are most frequently used in coding interviews to solve a class of problem known as "Top K" problems, which involce finding the k smallest or largest elements in a collection of elements.
